My first step to Git

ermmmm...
How to describe my moods now.I'm a bit exited.GitHub is a English web but I'm not good at English.Even worse,my level of coding is also poor.I believe one day I can do as the person I admiring do as long as I stick to it.
Git is an amazing world,I want to build a special zone like QQzone which I can spend some time to make it better.
I hope oneday I can have enough power so that I can earn enough money. And I also have a beautiful girlfriend who share the same happyness and sadness with me and bulid my own lovely family. When I have enough money,I will travel with my father,my mother and also my own family.
This is my dream.I deeply believe the happy days will come as long as I never give up! Come on!
